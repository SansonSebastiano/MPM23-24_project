# RoomFinder

**A project for the Mobile Programming and Multimedia course - MSc Computer Science - Universit√† degli Studi di Padova**

The project consists in creating a mobile application that respects all the mobile design and usability principles seen during classes. The app must be also developed using a cross-platform framework, optimizing so the writing of the code for both Android and iOS platforms. 

In particular the developed app allows the italian student community to easily examine all the rental proposals for the various accommodations scattered around the city of interest. The user will be able to examine the various proposals by comparing prices, location and all other metrics offered for a particular solution of interest. A further important aspect will be the possibility of being able to consult any roommates already present through a short summary, briefly explaining who are the other roomates. Furthermore, it will be possible to chat with the host of any apartment with the aim of exchanging useful information for both parties.
